Testing Hypermail:
==================

This directory is here for you to use in testing hypermail locally.
It is useful for testing new hypermail distributions and features
without impacting your production facilities.
 
You will find the following files in this directory:

    test-footer.hyp - HTML footer template file 
    test-index.hyp  - Index pages template file
    test-msg.hyp    - Message pages template file
    test.rc         - Test configuration file
    testhm          - Script to run test command lines
    diff_hypermail_archives.pl - Script to show diffs between two archives

To test hypermail:

    - Copy a mailbox you have to a local file named "testmail"

    - Edit the test-footer.hyp, test-index.hyp and test-msg.hyp
      template configuration files as appropritate for you needs.
 
    - Edit the test.rc and assure it is configured as you wish.

    - Verify that testhm is running the proper command line for
      the testing you are doing.
          
    - Type "testhm"

This will generate an archive under a newly created "testdir/"
directory.  Check it out with your favorite browser.

When you are done testing, 

    - remove the testdir directory,

    - remove the testmail file.
