<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="1">1. Why is the License Different ?</A></H3>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard (who is now the legal owner of Hypermail, since EIT was 
bought by VeriFone, which was bought by Hewlett-Packard) has put it
under the GNU license, a widely used "free software" license. This means 
that you can use and modify the source code as long as you make your changes 
publically available and do not charge for their use (although, under GNU, 
you can charge for their distribution).  More details are available at 
<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/">http://www.fsf.org/</A> and

<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="2">2. Will hypermail run on my system ?</A></H3>
<P>
Hypermail can compile and run as-is on most of the more popular UNIX systems 
today. If you're not sure if 
hypermail will run on your UNIX system, try compiling it and see!
<p>
Hypermail has been reported to work on MacOSX (X.2.6), with the advice
to use --disable-shared and manually execute make in src/pcre.
<P>
People have indeed ported hypermail to DOS, Windows 95, and Windows NT (but 
not Java ...yet). Installation advice for some Windows systems is available at
<A HREF="http://www.hypermail.org/win32.html">win32.html</A>.

<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="3">3. What Happened to EIT ?</A></H3>
<P>
A very old and established government contractor company called Electronic 
Instrumentation and Technology Inc.  made legal moves to obtain the eit.com 
domain. Since VeriFone/HP had no interest in keeping EIT, they dissolved it 
completely some months ago. This company had a trademark on EIT so the 
domain name was given to them. (Thank you InterNic...)

<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="5">5. What is the latest version of Hypermail ?</A></H3>
<P>
The latest stable version of Hypermail is Version 2.1.9. It is available from
<A HREF="http://www.hypermail-project.org">http://www.hypermail-project.org</A>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="6">6. Where can I get the latest version of Hypermail ?</A></H3>
<P>
The latest version of Hypermail is available from the Hypermail Development
Center at 

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hypermail/">SourceForge</a>
and/or at
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<A HREF="http://www.hypermail-project.org">http://www.hypermail-project.org/</A>
</P>

It and past versions are also available via FTP from

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="ftp://ftp.hypermail.org/hypermail/">ftp://ftp.hypermail.org/hypermail/</A></P>
<p>
The cvs server at <a href="http://cvs.hypermail.org">:pserver:cvs@cvs.hypermail.org:/CVS</a>
usually has a more recent but less tested version.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="7">7. How can I split the archives into months ?</A></H3>
<P>
<EM>I have a fat archive that I'd like to split up by month, like I see so many
others doing.  Is there a description somewhere of a procedure to follow,
or will I just have to think it through?</EM>
<P>
If you are using version 2.1.0 or later and either have gdbm or don't
do incremental updates, see the 

<a href="hmrc.html#folder_by_date">folder_by_date</a>

option. The simple way to use this is to add these to your .hmrc:
<blockquote>
folder_by_date="%y%m"
<br>usegdbm = 1
</blockquote>
and regenerate your archive from its mbox file.
<p>
An older alternative is a set of scripts in a directory
named <A HREF="source/archive/">archive/</A> that has tools to do just what 
you want to do.
<P>
If you want index files split by month but don't need to split the archive
into multiple directories, try adding &quot;monthly_index=1&quot; in your
config file (usually ~/.hmrc) (available in version 2.1). A summary.html
file will provide links to all the monthly indices.
This is probably appropriate for archives with a few thousand messages,
but for larger archives I recommend splitting into multiple directories.
<p>
 There's a script at
<a href="http://users.netrus.net/troc/perl.html">http://users.netrus.net/troc/perl.html</a>
called mms (monthly mail splitter) which has also been reported useful.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="8">8. How do I change the font on the pages ?</A></H3>
<P>
<EM>What I'd like to do is change the font of the archives pages.  I tried 
doing this by adding a &lt;FONT FACE=...&gt; tag in the header.hyp file and a 
&lt;FONT&gt; tag in the footer file, but it didn't work.  Is there something 
in the program itself that's preventing me from making this change?</EM>
<P>
Yes and no. Let me guess... You have <STRONG>hm_usetable = 1</STRONG>.  
The code for tables is not inheriting the FONT values and that they need 
to be set in the &lt;TH..&gt; tags.  If tables are not used it works as 
expected.
<P>
To test it put a 
<STRONG><SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt;FONT SIZE="1" FACE="GENEVA,ARIAL,HELVETICA"&gt;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL></STRONG>
in the test-index.hyp and test-msg.hyp. In  test-footer.hyp put
<STRONG><SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt;/FONT&gt;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL></STRONG>
<P>
With <STRONG>hm_usetable = 1</STRONG> in the test.rc file, then ran 
"<STRONG>hypermail -c test.rc -m testmail</STRONG>" and everything 
between the "menus" was the right FONT but the menus were not.
<P>
Then edit the test.rc file and set <STRONG>hm_usetable = 0</STRONG>. 
Next remove the existing testdir and rerun hypermail again. This time 
the FONT works as expected. 
<P>
Is this what is happening to you ?  If so the code will need to be modified.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="9">9. What is HM_MAILTO used for ?</A></H3>
<P>

<EM>I've enabled this option in .hyprc (the configuration file to which
the pipe script for my archive points). Unlike the other options, this one
does not create a link to mailto:admin@domain.com as I would expect. Any
ideas?</EM>
<P>
HM_MAILTO has a couple different uses. One is to trigger the insertion of
the &lt;LINK REV=made HREF=mailto:...&gt; header in the HTML sources.
This is most useable with ascii browsers such as lynx. 
<P>
<STRONG><SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     hm_mailto = [ email-address | NONE ] 
     <BR># 
     <BR># The address of the contact point that is put in the HTML header line 
     <BR># &lt;LINK REV=made HREF=mailto:hm_mailto&gt;
     <BR># 
     <BR># The &lt;LINK...&gt; header can be disabled by default by setting 
     <BR># mailto to NONE. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL></STRONG>
<P>
It can also be used in a hypermail page template file since it resolves 
to %m.
<P>
For example, your footer file might look like...
<STRONG><SMALL>
<P>&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="/images/bar.png" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="4" ALT="---------"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
<BR>&lt;ADDRESS&gt;
<BR>&lt;EM&gt;
<BR>&lt;SMALL&gt;
<BR>This archive was generated by %u on %g
<BR>&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;
<BR>Send administrative comments to&lt;A HREF="mailto:%m"&gt;%m&lt;/A&gt;
<BR>&lt;/P&gt;
<BR>&lt;/SMALL&gt;
<BR>&lt;/EM&gt;
<BR>&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;
<BR>&lt;/BODY&gt;
<BR>&lt;/HTML&gt;
</SMALL></STRONG>
<P>
In this case the %m is expanded to admin@domain.com.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="10">10. Can I send a message to the list from the web archive ?</A></H3>
<P>
<EM>I would like to add a link to the menu that says "Send a Message to the 
List." I read through the documentation on your website, and I think I 
know what I have to do. However, I cannot find an example of what a .hyp 
template file should look like. </EM>
<P>
That's what "Respond" on the menubar does. It allows a person
to reply to the existing message, with the reply sent to the list address.
And "mail a new topic" on the menubar allows a user to send
a new message to the list.
<P>
To enable this feature set
<P>
<STRONG><SMALL>
<BR>hm_hmail = listaddr@your-site.domain

<P>
<EM>I would like to use Hypermail on my Windows box. Can I ? If so how do
I build the latest version ?</EM>  
<P>
There is a complete description on how to build hypermail on a Windows
    system at <A HREF="http://www.hypermail.org/win32.html">win32.html</A>.  This was written by
Bob Crispen &lt;bob.crispen@boeing.com&gt;. (Thanks Bob!)


<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="12">How can I remove a listserver subject prefix ?</A></H3>
<P>
<EM>The Subject index page does not seem to do the right sorting. My list
has a "subject prefix" so people can filter their inbound mail better. Is
that confusing the sorting ?</EM>
<P>
Yes.  Hypermail functions that deal with replies look for the Re: and 
return a pointer to the subject line after the "Re: ".  
The listserver software is prefixing the subject line contents with
[subject-prefix].  For example:
<P>
<STRONG><SMALL>
Initial message: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Subject: [subject-prefix] the subject of the message
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Replies: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Subject: [subject-prefix] Re: the subject of the message
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL></STRONG>
<P>
The best solution is to use the directive
<BLOCKQUOTE>
        <STRONG>stripsubject = [subject-prefix]</STRONG>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
in the config file for that list. Then [subject-prefix] is stripped before    
the Reply processing occurs and the proper things happen. This is the proper 
fix since hypermail would need to know to strip the [subject-prefix] from
the initial messages to get it right.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="13">Which configuration file should I use ?</A></H3>
<P>
<EM>Which configuration file should I use ?. Is it the hypermail.rc file 
in the Configs directory? I'm trying to edit the appearance of pages created 
by hypermail, but I think I'm trying to edit the wrong config file.</EM>
<P>
With one of the later versions you can use the -v option to generate 
a config file that you can use. There is not just one config file. 
What are included are examples. 
<P>
<STRONG><SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   $ hypermail -v &gt; some-file.rc 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL></STRONG>
 
Edit the some-file.rc and set the values to what you want.
<P>
Then run hypermail using the config file by:
 
<STRONG><SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  $ hypermail -c some-file.rc. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL></STRONG>
 
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="14">Why is the downloaded file name different when I download hypermail.tar.gz ?</A></H3>
<P>
<EM>
The source is available from 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="http://www.hypermail-project.org/hypermail.tar.gz">www.hypermail.org/hypermail.tar.gz</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
However: When downloading though IE v4 browser on an NT 
PC, you get a file called hypermail_tar.tar.
</EM>
<P>
Depending on your browser MIME type setup and support applications,
the filename downloaded might be hypermail.tar, hypermail.tar.gz, etc.
In any case, you will be informed as to the filename when you actually 
download it onto a Windows/NT PC.  Use that name from that point forward.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="15">Can I throttle hypermail's CPU usage ?</A></H3>
<P>
<EM>
I'm looking for a good way to throttle hypermail. When it runs it is
taking over both CPU's on my system. Is there a way to have it limit
itself?
</EM>
<P>
There is currently no "nice" call in hypermail to limit itself.  Maybe 
we can consider it in the future. You might run it as a subcommand to 
nice.  For example in an aliases file:
<STRONG><SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 "|nice someval 'hypermail command line'"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL></STRONG>
I've NEVER tried this so... ;) 
<P>
You might also be looking at a very large archive with lots of messages
being the cause.  If so then try breaking it up into smaller archives
such as monthly archives.  Tools are available for that in the latest
release.
<P>
And if the list is a high traffic list, consider not running it from a
sendmail alias and instead, run it from cron. (To assure it does not
run unnecessarily, consider using 'make' to check dependencies on the
inbound mailbox and the archive itself. If the mailbox is newer, then
run the hypermail command. If not, then no new message have been received
so don't bother running it. 

<P>
If the you are using the linkquotes option and incremental update 
(-u option), add a searchbackmsgnum line to your config file.
It controls the tradeoff between speed and
the reliability of finding the right source for quoted text.
Try to set it to the largest number of messages between a
message and the final direct reply to that message.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="16">How can I make my archive searchable ?</A></H3>
<P>
<EM>Where can I find a program that provides an easy way of adding a
"search this archive" feature to my hypermail archive?
</EM>
<P>
These seem to be the most popular choices:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.htdig.org">Htdig</a>
<li><a href="http://swish-e.org">Swish-E</a>
<li><a href="http://webglimpse.org/">Glimpse</a>
<li><a href="http://www.namazu.org/">Namazu</a>
<li><a href="http://search.mnogo.ru/">mnoGoSearch</a>
</ul>
Swish-E comes with a script (index_hypermail.pl) that is customized for
indexing Hypermail archives. <a href="index_hypermail.txt">index_hypermail.txt</a>
has a description of how to use it.
<p>
 You can also use search engines by putting text such as this on
your web page (although this search produces results from an entire site,
not just the email archive):
<br>&lt;form action=http://www.google.com/search&gt;
<br>&lt;input type=text name=as_q&gt;
<br>&lt;input type=hidden name=as_sitesearch value=hypermail-project.org&gt;
<br>&lt;input type=submit value=&quot;Search Hypermail&quot;&gt;
<br>&lt;/form>
<p>
You can probably get more complete (but apparently not recent) info at:

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="17">How does hypermail decide whether messages are in the same thread?</A></H3>
<P>
 It uses the In-Reply-To: header if that is available. If not, it uses
the References: header if that is available. If these are not available,
it looks for previous messages with the same subject header. Matches based
on the subject are listed as "maybe" replies.
<P>
 If the linkquotes option is used, it will also search the message bodies
of the previous searchbackmsgnum (default = 500) messages for text that
looks like it is being quoted in the current message. If it finds one or more
prior messages with such text matches, it will treat the one with the longest
match as the message being replied to. The exact algorithms for deciding what
is quoted text are a bit complex. These matches override the In-Reply-To:
and References: info (this rule may deserve further thought).

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="18">How can I have multiple mailboxes produce one archive?</A></H3>
<P>
  One simple way is to combine them into one mailbox, and send that to
hypermail. Something like <br><blockquote>&quot;cat file1 file2 file3 &gt; combined&quot;</blockquote> 
should do that.
<p>
 Another way is to invoke hypermail several times, using the -u flag for
any mailboxes that you want added after the html archive has been started:
<pre>
 hypermail -m file1
 hypermail -u -m file2
 hypermail -u -m file3
</pre>
<p>
 Do not try to send hypermail more than one mailbox at a time, or send
it a second mailbox without using the -u flag or the increment=1 or
increment=-1 option.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="19">I have received an email with attachment that needs octet-stream. What should I do?</A></H3>
<p>
No attachment "needs" octet-stream. octet-stream is a label that describes
the attachment as being "a stream of octets". What is that you say? Well, the
application didn't know any more specifics and thus it identified it as good
as possible. It knows it is a stream of octets, nothing else.
<p>
So, an attachment coming as "octet-stream" can be pretty much ANYTHING. You
have no idea, and neither does anyone else. The only way to figure out is to
download the file and see for yourself, ask the person who mailed it or to
hope that the mail it came with describes what the attachment was about.
<p>
"octet-stream" could just as well be named "I haven't got the slightest idea
what this is, but I know it is built up with a series of bytes".

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="20">Why is Hypermail ignoring some messages?</A></H3>
<p>One possibility is that those messages have a header saying
<blockquote>
X-No-Archive: yes
</blockquote>
which seems to indicate that the author doesn't want them included in any
archive. This is controlled by a configure option which defaults to:
<blockquote>
deleted = "X-Hypermail-Deleted X-No-Archive"
</blockquote>
To get Hypermail to treat these as normal messages, add this to your
config file (which is ~/.hmrc by default) or alter the "deleted" line
in your existing config file to:
<blockquote>
deleted = "X-Hypermail-Deleted"
</blockquote>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hr.yellow.png" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=2 ALT="----"></P>
<H3><A HREF="#" NAME="21">Bogus dates are causing some emails to be put in a strange folder. Is there an easy way around this?</A></H3>
<p>
If the bad dates were caused by a computer with the date set absurdly, try
running <a href="http://gradha.sdf-eu.org/program/mailbox_date_trimmer.en.html">
mailbox_date_trimmer.py</a>, available in the Hypermail's contrib directory.
<p>
If the bad dates are in a format that Hypermail doesn't understand, then
you will probably need to edit them manually.
